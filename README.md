# Pet Clinic Web App

Spring Boot application written from scratch using IntelliJ and SpringInitializr:
- Java 11
- JPA (Hibernate) and H2 database
- Thymeleaf
- Unit tests and integration tests (JUnit 5)
- Continuous integration (CircleCI)
- Bootstrap CSS
- Project Lombok
- i18n internationalization
- Profiles (Map and JPA implementation)


Project was created through the Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru course, by John Thompson, and is still in development phase.<br/>
Many elements are borrowed from original Spring Pet Clinic Application.
